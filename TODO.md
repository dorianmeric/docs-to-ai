- ingest excel files. for investor feedback. Can it extract pnl info. Can it calculate a fee? Or just read the contents.
- ingest emails saved in the folder. Convert to eml first? This needs a python script on a system that has Outlook installed.
- add more metadata for each file: file size,  last modified date (to allow to filder by date range). number of pages?,


other ideas:
- pandadoc - model deal. In order to model the fees.


- ingest text files (?) -  no
- add a summary of each doc in memory? to speed up searching maybe.
