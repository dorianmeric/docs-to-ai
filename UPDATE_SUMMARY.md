# Update Summary: Topic-Based Organization

## What Changed

The PDF document query system has been updated to support **topic-based organization** using folder structure. This allows you to organize PDFs by category/topic and search/filter accordingly.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Automatic Topic Extraction
- Folder names automatically become topic tags
- Example: `pdfs/Machine_Learning/neural_nets.pdf` → Topic: "Machine_Learning"
- Handles duplicate filenames across different topics

### 2. Topic Filtering
- Search within specific topics
- List documents by topic
- View statistics per topic

### 3. Enhanced Metadata
Every document chunk now includes:
- `filename`: Original PDF filename
- `filepath`: Full path to the PDF
- `topic`: Extracted from folder name
- `page`: Page number in the PDF

## Updated Files

### Core Files Modified

1. **config.py**
   - Added `USE_FOLDER_AS_TOPIC` flag
   - Added `DEFAULT_TOPIC` for uncategorized PDFs

2. **pdf_processor.py**
   - New method: `extract_topic_from_path()`
   - Updated `extract_text_from_pdf()` to include topic
   - Updated `process_pdf()` to accept base directory
   - Chunk IDs now include topic for uniqueness

3. **vector_store.py**
   - `list_documents()` now returns dict with topic info
   - New method: `list_topics()`
   - New method: `delete_topic()`
   - Enhanced `get_stats()` with topic distribution
   - `delete_document()` now uses filepath instead of filename

4. **ingest_pdfs.py**
   - Always searches recursively to support topic folders
   - Detects and displays topics during ingestion
   - Shows per-topic statistics in summary
   - Topic-aware progress display

5. **mcp_server.py**
   - Updated `search_documents` tool with topic filter
   - Updated `list_documents` tool with topic filter
   - New `list_topics` tool
   - Enhanced `get_document_stats` with topic info
   - Search results show topic for each match

### Documentation Updated

1. **README.md**
   - Added "Document Organization" section
   - Updated features list
   - Added topic configuration section
   - Enhanced example queries

2. **QUICKSTART.md**
   - Added overview section explaining topic system
   - Updated ingestion instructions
   - Added topic-specific query examples
   - Enhanced troubleshooting section

3. **TOPICS.md** (NEW)
   - Complete guide to topic-based organization
   - Best practices for folder naming
   - Use cases and examples
   - Advanced customization options

## How to Use

### Organize Your PDFs

```
pdfs/
├── Machine_Learning/
│   ├── neural_networks.pdf
│   └── deep_learning.pdf
├── Python_Programming/
│   ├── basics.pdf
│   └── advanced.pdf
└── Data_Science/
    └── statistics.pdf
```

### Ingest with Topics

```bash
python ingest_pdfs.py --pdf-dir ./pdfs
```

Output shows topics:
```
Found 5 PDF files
Detected topics: Data_Science, Machine_Learning, Python_Programming

[1/5] Processing: neural_networks.pdf
  Topic: Machine_Learning
  ✓ Added 45 chunks
```

### Query by Topic in Claude

Once connected to Claude:

**List topics:**
```
"What topics are available?"
```

**Search within topic:**
```
"Search for neural networks in the Machine_Learning topic"
```

**List documents by topic:**
```
"Show me all Python_Programming documents"
```

**Get statistics:**
```
"Give me statistics about the document collection"
```

## MCP Tools Reference

### search_documents
```json
{
  "query": "neural networks",
  "topic": "Machine_Learning",  // Optional filter
  "max_results": 5
}
```

### list_documents
```json
{
  "topic": "Python_Programming"  // Optional filter
}
```

### list_topics (NEW)
```json
{}
```
Returns all available topics with document counts.

### get_document_stats
```json
{}
```
Returns full statistics including topic distribution.

## Migration Guide

### If You Have Existing Ingested PDFs

**Option 1: Keep existing structure (no topics)**
- Set `USE_FOLDER_AS_TOPIC = False` in `config.py`
- Everything works as before

**Option 2: Add topics to existing PDFs**
1. Organize PDFs into topic folders
2. Re-run ingestion with `--reset`:
   ```bash
   python ingest_pdfs.py --pdf-dir ./pdfs --reset
   ```

### Breaking Changes

1. **list_documents()** now returns list of dicts instead of list of strings
   - Old: `["file1.pdf", "file2.pdf"]`
   - New: `[{"filename": "file1.pdf", "topic": "ML", "filepath": "..."}]`

2. **delete_document()** now requires filepath instead of filename
   - Old: `delete_document("file.pdf")`
   - New: `delete_document("/full/path/to/file.pdf")`

3. **Chunk IDs** now include topic
   - Ensures uniqueness across topics
   - Prevents collisions with same filename in different folders

## Benefits

### 1. Better Organization
- Clear categorization of documents
- Easy to see what documents you have in each area

### 2. Faster Searches
- Filter searches to relevant topics
- Reduce noise in results

### 3. Scalability
- Handle large document collections
- Organize by project, subject, client, etc.

### 4. Flexibility
- Same filename in different topics (no conflicts)
- Easy to reorganize (just move files and re-ingest)

## Configuration Options

### config.py

```python
# Enable/disable topic extraction
USE_FOLDER_AS_TOPIC = True  # Set False to disable

# Default topic for PDFs not in folders
DEFAULT_TOPIC = "uncategorized"

# Other existing settings...
CHUNK_SIZE = 1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200
DEFAULT_SEARCH_RESULTS = 5
MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS = 20
```

## Examples

### Research Papers

```
papers/
├── Computer_Vision/
├── NLP/
└── Reinforcement_Learning/
```

**Claude query:** "Compare Computer Vision and NLP approaches to feature extraction"

### Company Documentation

```
docs/
├── HR_Policies/
├── Engineering/
└── Sales/
```

**Claude query:** "Search Engineering docs for deployment procedures"

### Course Materials

```
course/
├── Week_1/
├── Week_2/
└── Week_3/
```

**Claude query:** "What topics were covered in Week 2?"

## Troubleshooting

### Topics not detected
**Issue:** PDFs are in base directory, not subfolders  
**Fix:** Create topic folders and move PDFs

### Wrong topic assigned
**Issue:** PDF in wrong folder  
**Fix:** Move PDF and re-ingest with `--reset`

### Topic names have spaces
**Issue:** `Data Science` folder name  
**Fix:** Rename to `Data_Science` (use underscores)

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_system.py
```

All tests should pass with topic support enabled.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Nested Topics**: `AI/Machine_Learning/Deep_Learning`
2. **Multi-topic Tags**: Tag single document with multiple topics
3. **Topic Hierarchies**: Parent/child topic relationships
4. **Custom Metadata**: Add custom tags beyond topics
5. **Topic Synonyms**: Map multiple names to same topic
